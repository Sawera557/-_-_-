# Upscale Video quality With Real-ESRGAN
Experiment using GANs to upscale video quality, Utilizing Real-ESRGAN to process each image frame of video to improve the quality ofvideo overall.

Choose a GAN's model for example: RealESRGAN for now
ðŸŽž Step 1: Splitting Up the Video
First, we break the video into image frames.
ðŸ’¡ Step 2: Process Each image Frame with GANs
Utilize GANs to work some magic on each image to upscale it.
ðŸ’¾ Step 3: Saving the Improved image
After each image is upscaled, save it in original video sequence order.
ðŸ”„ Step 4: Putting it All Back Together
Finally, put all the upscaled images back together to create a super-duper enhanced video!
